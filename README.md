### üê≥ Run the Demo Locally with Docker Compose

#### **Prerequisites**
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed  
- No other services running on ports **3000**, **3001**, **3002**, or **27018**  
  _(You can change these in `docker-compose.yml` if needed)_

#### **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**

2. **Rename** the provided '.env.example' file to '.env' in the project **root**
   - **Be careful** as there are several .env.examples provided, one for each individual service. *However* the only one necessary for docker-compose is the one in the **ROOT** directory!
   - The other .env.examples should only be used as templates if you wish to run the project locally without Docker.
    
4. **Ensure no other processes are using ports** `3000`, `3001`, `3002`, or `27018`.
   - If there are, you can adjust the port mappings inside your `docker-compose.yml`.
5. From the **project-root** run
   `docker compose up --build` or `docker-compose up --build` *The command will depend on which version of Docker you have*
6. Once the container starts use your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/)
7. Log in using one of the demo accounts:
   - Users: `john`, `emma`, `michael`, `olivia`, `david`, `sophia`
   - Password for all is `password`
8. Admin account:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `password`
9. üéâ Enjoy exploring the demo!
